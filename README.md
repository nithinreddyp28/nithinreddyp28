## 📊 Notable Projects

### 1. [Crisis Management and Public Safety (Toronto)](https://github.com/nithinreddyp28/A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Crisis-Management-and-Public-Safety-in-Toronto)**
This project leverages machine learning to improve crisis management in Toronto by analyzing crisis event data to predict patterns and apprehensions. By examining event types, time of occurrence, and neighborhood locations, the study provides insights to enhance public safety and response strategies.
- Classification: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting.
- Clustering: K-Means for high-risk neighborhood identification.
Key Techniques:
- Binary Encoding: Apprehension status as a binary variable.
- Cyclical Encoding: Encoding time-based features for better pattern recognition.

### 2. **[Predictive Modeling with ML:  Customer Churn Prediction: Unlocking Insights into Customer Retention](https://github.com/nithinreddyp28/Customer-Churn-Prediction)**
This project explores customer churn prediction using machine learning, focusing on analyzing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral data. The goal is to predict whether a telecom customer will churn, helping businesses improve retention strategies. Various models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, SVM, and KNN, were employed for predictive analysis.
Key Techniques:
- Binary Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical format.
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Balanced the dataset for better model performance.
- Cyclical Feature Encoding: Applied sine & cosine transformations for time-based patterns.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models for improved accuracy and recall
Tools & Technologies:
- PySpark: Scalable data processing and ML model training.
- Python Libraries:

### 3. **[Vehicle Collision Analysis](https://github.com/nithinreddyp28/Vehicle-Collision-Analysis)**
The Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis - NYC project examines traffic accidents in New York City using NYPD collision data. The study identifies key factors contributing to injuries and fatalities, highlights high-risk areas, and applies predictive modeling to improve road safety. Key findings reveal that Brooklyn and Queens have the highest fatalities, while distraction, right-of-way violations, and unsafe speed are major contributing factors. Regression models and statistical tests validate these insights, supporting data-driven safety initiatives like Vision Zero.

- Statistical Tests (ANOVA, Chi-Square)

### 4. **[Employee Management System](https://github.com/nithinreddyp28/SQL-Database-for-Employee-Management)**
The SQL Database Project: Employee Management System is a Payroll Management System (PMS) designed to streamline payroll operations, employee management, tax compliance, and reporting. It automates payroll calculations, tax deductions, and payment processing while ensuring data security through role-based access control. The system manages employee details, department assignments, time tracking, tax calculations, and reporting. The database design follows 1:1, 1:M, and M:M relationships, enabling efficient management of employees, payroll, attendance, and finance operations.
Tools & Technologies:
- Database Management System (DBMS): MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server
SQL Concepts Applied:
- Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling – Designing relationships between employees, payroll, attendance, and departments
