## üìä Notable Projects

### 1. [Crisis Management and Public Safety (Toronto)](https://github.com/nithinreddyp28/A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Crisis-Management-and-Public-Safety-in-Toronto)**
This project leverages machine learning to improve crisis management in Toronto by analyzing crisis event data to predict patterns and apprehensions. By examining event types, time of occurrence, and neighborhood locations, the study provides insights to enhance public safety and response strategies.
- Classification: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting.
- Clustering: K-Means for high-risk neighborhood identification.
Key Techniques:
- Binary Encoding: Apprehension status as a binary variable.
- Cyclical Encoding: Encoding time-based features for better pattern recognition.

### 2. **[Predictive Modeling with ML:  Customer Churn Prediction: Unlocking Insights into Customer Retention](https://github.com/nithinreddyp28/Customer-Churn-Prediction)**
This project explores customer churn prediction using machine learning, focusing on analyzing customer demographics, account details, and behavioral data. The goal is to predict whether a telecom customer will churn, helping businesses improve retention strategies. Various models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, SVM, and KNN, were employed for predictive analysis.
Key Techniques:
- Binary Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical format.
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Balanced the dataset for better model performance.
- Cyclical Feature Encoding: Applied sine & cosine transformations for time-based patterns.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized models for improved accuracy and recall
Tools & Technologies:
